## About Me

Hi! I'm Qinyi Liu. I am a PhD Candidate in the Centre for the Science of Learning & Technology (SLATE) at Univerisity of Bergen, working with Prof. Mohammad Khalil. During my PhD period, I also visited the University of South Australia and Monash University as a visiting scholar funded by Meltzerfondet. 


I have an interdisciplinary background in computer science and social science, holding degrees in both fields. I pursued my master's studies at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Liverpool. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from Chongqing University. During my time at Edinburgh, I was part of the [Covid-19 Response Governance Mapping Project](https://efi.ed.ac.uk/covid-19-response-governance-mapping/). I also worked at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with [Joseph Tucker](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/people/joseph-tucker-md-phd/), where I contributed to [website development](https://www.seshglobal.org/) and research dissemination. 


## Research Interests
My research interests are mainly in privacy-enhancing technology (PET) + learning analytics, aiming to utilizing state-of-arts privacy-enhancing technology to advance trustworthy AI for education, with a focus on develop and fine-tune domain specific PET for application.

- **AI for education:** learning analytics, knowledge tracing, adaptive learning system
- **Privacy-enhancing techniques:** synthetic data generation, differential privacy, machine unlearning, federated learning, zero-knowledge proof
- **Trust and robust AI:** fairness and explainability in AI, Adversarial machine learning, uncertainty in machine learning
